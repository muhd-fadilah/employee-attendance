# Employee Attendance
This repository provides simple APIs intended for managing employee attendance, created with Express.js framework and Mongodb database. I strongly recommend you to run this project with docker compose via this command:
```sh
docker compose up --build
```
However, if you want to use this project without docker, just change your directory to "node-web" folder and run this project with npm. Don't forget to create the ".env" file first. You may use ".env.example" file as reference for creating ".env" file. Please note that this method is not tested yet.
